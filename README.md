## How to Use

Load one of the provided volume files through the GUI. 
Rotate the orbit camera around the bounding box using the left mouse button. Zoom using the scroll wheel. 

The editor allows for adding aditional densities (ISO) and their alpha values. So for example you could render the bones as non-transparent and the skin - somewhat transparent. The sliders will have thei color of their corresponding layer.

## Framework Description

This framework uses three.js and d3.js for volume rendering and setting the appearance, respectively. 
The following files are provided: 
* **index.html**: contains the HTML content. Please enter your names! Otherwise, it does not need to be changed 
(but can be, if required). 
* **style.css**: CSS styles (can be adjusted, but does not need to be changed). 
* **three.js/build/three.js**: Contains the three.js library. **Do not modify!**
* **d3.js/d3.v7.js**: Contains the d3.js library. **Do not modify!**
* **shaders**: Folder containing a dummy vertex and fragment shader. **Add your shaders to this folder!** 
* **js**: Folder containing all JavaScript files. **Add new classes as separate js-files in this folder!** 
    * **visvu.js**: Main script file. Needs to be modified. 
    * **shader.js**: Base shader class. Does not need to be modified. Derive your custom shader materials from this class!
    * **testShader.js**: Example shader class demonstrating how to create and use a shader material 
    using external .essl files. Should not be used in the final submission.
    * **camera.js**: Simple orbit camera that moves nicely around our volumes. Does not need to be modified. 
    
Created 2021 by Manuela Waldner, Diana Schalko, amd Laura Luidolt based on the VisVU Task 1 Qt framework 
initially created by Johanna Schmidt, Tobias Klein, and Laura Luidolt. Updated 2022 and 2023 by Manuela Waldner. 

## JavaScript

Javascript files should go to folder 'js' and end with '.js'. All new javascript files have to be included in index.html. 

Recommended IDE: Webstorm (free educational version available using TU Wien e-mail address)

*Important*: do not run index.html from the file system! Only execute it from inside WebStorm 
(by selecting a browser icon from the top right panel that appears when you open index.html) 
or from hosting the project within another web server. Opening index.html directly in the browser without a server
will result in an error when trying to load the the .essl shader files. 


## Shaders

.essl is the OpenGL ES shading language. Shader files should all be located in the folder 'shaders' and end with '.essl'.  

Recommended code editor: Visual Studio Code (free): https://code.visualstudio.com/

Install syntax highlighting for shading languages: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=slevesque.shader

Enable syntax highlighting: open shader file --> in the bar on the bottom right, switch from plain text to GLSL.
